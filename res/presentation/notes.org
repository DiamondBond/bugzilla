** Windows
On Windows there were some strange memory corruption issues that I had to manually resolve (these issues were pertaining to the mismanagement of various char widths and strcpy() calls)

** POSIX
On POSIX systems there was only 1 issue: the pause_screen() function does not really pause the screen and instead waits for 3 seconds before continuing. This has been fixed in this commit:
